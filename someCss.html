    <p class="dotted">With its resplendent golden touches and ethereal subjects, it is no wonder that The Kiss is one of the most famous paintings in the world. Made by Gustav Klimt, it exemplifies the artist's famous Golden Phase, in which he adorned canvases with shimmering gold leaf. Now, fans of Klimt's iconic style can see 63 of his masterpieces in a new digital exhibition entitled Klimt vs. Klimt: The Man of Contradictions. </p>
